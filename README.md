# Crowd Sourced Trivia

[play the game](https://plustim.github.io/Crowd-Sourced-Trivia/)

This is a jQuery based trivia game that asks random user submitted trivia questions and displays a "relevant" giphy image after each answer. It currently pulls from several different categories, however in the future I may add a category selector if they get more entries in the public database.
